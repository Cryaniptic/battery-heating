# PAST-Avionics-05

This project is a testbed for a battery heating system designed to keep lithium ion batteries from freezing over in a space enviroment.

The code was generated in STM32cubeMX, and is built using arm-none-eabi-gcc. 

Ideally I would jlink or serial wire debug over an ST-link, however due to unknown reasons, this option is not working and so I have to make do with uploading over USART with an FTDI dongle :/
